# xsint - osint simplified

This is a OSINT tool I wrote a few years ago and I'm deciding to publish it.
I will most likely not update this all the time but here it is.
I'm open to contributions. 

## Installation
```shell
git clone https://github.com/memorypudding/xsint && cd xsint
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 xsint.py
```

## TODO
```
complete settings
add a paste lookup
add emailrep
add wigle.net
```
